Note! It seems there are two classes of cams on the market (looking similar). Sometimes this cam needs a Distortion-Calibration with the Boardmanager or easier a lense exchange!

SEPARATE ELP Lense NO DISTORTION for mounting into another cam platins -> 

https://de.aliexpress.com/item/4001351729080.html?spm=a2g0o.order_list.order_list_main.17.5e7e5c5fWyLfze&gatewayAdapt=glo2deu
ORIGINAL ELP 90° Lense with metall lense holder. M12 x 0,5mm should fit in several platin cams. Anyway you can change the metall lense holder

Lense - School:

2,8mm focal lenght means 100°
2,1mm focal lenght means 90°
Range 100°-90° is the best for autodarts.io with a distance cam <-> wall around 35-40cm

Important parameters for several cams:

TV distortion <1% (means no distortion)
Mjpeg range between 640x480 and 1280x720 (minimum) 
20-30 FPS (20min. and 30max. is enough)
maximum power consumption not more than 250mw (most <160mw)
Lense size FOV between 90 and 100°

All "Usbfhd01m" type of cams should work but beware! Always look for the parameters!
You can use the followed link -> 

https://de.aliexpress.com/premium/usb-camera-elp-usbfhd01m.html?dida=y&SearchText=usb+camera+elp+usbfhd01m&trafficChannel=ppc&catId=0&maxPrice=50&g=y

WORKING "NO DISTORTION" <1% - EXAMPLES:
USBFHD01M-L21 is the ELP cam with an original 2,1mm Lense that means 90°
USBFHD01M-L29 is the ELP cam with an original 2,9mm Lense that menas 100°
USBFHD01M-L28 is the ELP cam with an original 2,8mm Lense that means 98° (nearly 100° human eyes will see no difference)

ATTENTION!
FOLLOWING LENSE TYPES HAS AN DISTORTION <3% (not so good!)
USBFHD01M-H100 means 100° (but <3% distortion)
USBFHD01M-L297 means 92° (but <3% distortion)

Anyway there are several another cams on the market that could work, but with the examples and hints above you will do mutch easier to buy the right ones! 

NOTE! It`s always good to have a 4th cam for reserve. It is not a bad idea to have an extra good SET of ELP lenses 90 or 100° at home as a reserve. It's happened that recommended cameras, although described as NO DISTORTION, still had distortion (cause fabrication changed, firmware etc..., so it's good when you can change lenses quickly and easily! And the price with the ELP lenses NO DISTORTION 90/ 100° (as described in the link above) is also affordable for the wallet!

Good luck and have fun with autodarts.io
;O)
